    This react app is made from hooks and is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
    You choose how many points you want the max to be.
    It shows three options(Rock, Paper or Scissors) and when you click one it has a 3 second count down.
    During that 3 second countdown, it says 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!'
    It then shows the computers choice and the outcome.
    If you win, you get a point
    If the computer wins, the computer gets a point.
    The first to the max points wins the whole game and it says whether you won or lost at the end.
